==========

Convenient CUDA wrappers for easy GPU programming Smart CUDA library is a lightweight C/C++ wrapper of the CUDA runtime API for productive natural-like CUDA programming. Smart CUDA follows the natural CUDA programming style; however, it provides low level abstraction to allow for a more convenient programming. In this way, Smart CUDA enhances developer productivity while attaining very high performance. Smart CUDA integrates seamlessly with C/C++ arrays and pointers, STL vector, and Thrust arrays. Smart CUDA only wraps the data on the device and host, therefore data on the host and device can have several wrappers and different views. This makes it very flexible, and allows easy integration with other platform and libraries.

Why Smart CUDA library?

Even though I am relatively new to C/C++ and CUDA programming, I realized that a lightweight wrapper could boost gpu programming productivity. Thus, I developed several wrappers that preserved the natural programming style as I went through the CUDA Programming Guide. Smart CUDA is the compilation of the basic wrappers I have currently developed. Smart CUDA library is meant to complement the efforts of other libraries such as Thrust and Magma and help boost gpu programming productivity.
